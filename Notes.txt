Understood DOM as browser interprets it by sketching DOM tree by hand
and tracing via examples that used jQuery.

My understanding of a callback:
Callback means to call a function or execute code asynchronously when a response is received.

DOM mamipulation such as adding, removing DOM nodes dynamically using
jQuery as well as other cool jQuery methods for interacting with DOM.

Learned about Event Handling, Event Delegation using jQuery and also,
jQuery's convenience methods for browser events via documentation.
